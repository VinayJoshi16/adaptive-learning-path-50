# Frontend API base URL (used for sign-in, sign-up, sessions).
# - Local dev: leave unset; Vite proxies /api to localhost:3001.
# - Production: REQUIRED. Set to your deployed backend URL including /api, e.g.:
#   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api
# Then rebuild the frontend (Vite bakes this in at build time).
# VITE_API_URL=
